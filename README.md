## Problem Description
A town is in need of essential resources (food, materials, and energy) to support its
citizens and establish new buildings. The town’s prosperity level reflects the well-being
of its residents, and the key to enhancing prosperity lies in strategically establishing
buildings that require specific resources. The goal of this project is to design a search
agent tasked with finding a plan to elevate the town’s prosperity level to 100. The search
agent operates within a budget of 100,000 units and must carefully manage the available
resources. There is no additional source of income beyond the initial budget, and the
town has a storage limit of 50 units per resource. Resources are consumed with each
action taken by the agent, whether it be establishing buildings or requesting deliveries.
The agent must consider the varying impacts of different actions on both prosperity and
resources. In addition, using resources requires spending money, which is what these
resources cost.
The agent’s objective is to search for a plan, if available, that can lead to achieving the
target prosperity level, based on the initial state description and a set of potential actions.
